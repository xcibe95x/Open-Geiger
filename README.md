Hello World

This is repo is a project PlaceHolder for a Project Revival.

Years ago, i promised an easy to build and realiable geiger counter, now i can't really promise it will be accurate it depends on a lot of factors.

The Idea is to make it fully open so we can achieve together
an open source geiger counter at the end of everyone.

I believe in moder days everyone should have one
And they all seems so unreasonably expensive and not much accurate.

So everyone shall be able to build one.

I have studied some electronics in my life, and i have been tearing apart / fixing and creating stuff sicne i was a small living being.

So since my knowledge is i assume "Basic" in this matter and Rusty

Making this project open source will allow it to improve i hope, both electrically and programmatically, aswell as scentifically, since people might be able to calibrate at some point with good radiation sources.

So i will provide the basics here and simplify and do small improvements to my current Geiger Counter.

I'll see you when the time has come. Thanks for Reading this nonsense.
